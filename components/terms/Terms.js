            natural person receiving the order and his address.Progetto 4.0
            reserves the right to subdivide the Order into several shipments,
            based on the availability of the Products for delivery, and the
            Customer will receive the Products separately based on their
            availability for shipment.Upon receipt of the product, the Customer
            must verify that the package is perfectly closed. If the package is
            not intact or is damaged, the Customer must immediately report the
            complaints to the courier, otherwise the Product will be considered
            regularly delivered.The Products must be checked by the Customer at
            the time of delivery, to verify that they correspond to the items
            ordered and that they do not present production defects or lack of
            conformity. The legal guarantees provided for by current legislation
            are applicable to the sale of the Products, in addition to any other
            conventional guarantees provided to the Customer. ‍ <br />
            <br />

            Product restored, free of charge, by means of repair or replacement
            in the event of manufacturing defects or defects of conformity,
            unless the remedy requested is objectively impossible or excessively
            burdensome compared to the other. If one of the cases provided for
            by law occurs, the Customer may request an appropriate reduction in
            the price or the termination of the contract and the consequent
            reimbursement of the price paid. ‍ <br />
            <br />
            The Customer shall be obliged to report the defect within two months
            from the date on which it was discovered by following the

          <h3>10. Right of Withdrawal and Return </h3>
          <p>
            Within fourteen days from the date of delivery or collection of the
            Products, the Customer has the right to withdraw from the contract
            by following the instructions indicated on the Site and using the
            form provided in the "Return" section. ‍ <br />

            The courier designated by Progetto 4.0 will collect the package
            containing the returned Products without any charge to the Customer
            only if the same has correctly performed the above procedure,
            failing which, the cost of return and any liability for loss, theft,
            damage or delay in delivery will be borne by the Customer.The
            Customer undertakes to return the Products for which he has
            exercised his right of withdrawal within fourteen days from the date
            on which he communicated his determination to withdraw from the
            contract.Progetto 4.0 reserves the right to refuse the return of
            those Products that may be damaged, deteriorated, dirty or in a
            state such as to make it clear, unequivocally, that they have been
            used for purposes other than customer checks strictly necessary to
            ascertain the nature and characteristics of the Product purchased. ‍
            <br />
            <br />
            The Products must be returned in their original packaging,
            accompanied by all the labels with which they were received.
            Otherwise the return of the Product will not be accepted.Following
            the legitimate exercise of the Right of Withdrawal and Return,
            Progetto 4.0 will proceed with the refund of the price of the
            Products returned within fourteen days. The refund may be withheld
            until Progetto 4.0 has received and verified the Product or until
            the Customer proves that the product has been returned correctly and
            in good condition. ‍ <br />
            <br />
            The above refund will be made by crediting the amount paid by the
            Customer to be executed in the same way of payment used for the
            purchase, unless the Customer has expressly agreed otherwise and
            provided that the latter does not incur any cost as a result of the
            refund.
